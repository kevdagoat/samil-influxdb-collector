See this blog post for a full explanation and instructions: [Logging Solar Inverter Output with a Raspberry Pi](https://lucascosti.com/blog/2017/08/logging-solar-inverter-output-with-a-raspberry-pi/).

This script has been modified from the original script hosted on the now-seemingly-defunct Solar Freaks forum.
